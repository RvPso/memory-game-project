Memory Game project made with â™¥ @ Udacity
# How The Game Works
-1 - The game consists of 12 or 16 cards based on what difficulty (EASY - CHALLENGING) the player choose 
-2 - The player has to pick over two cards.
-3 - If the two cards match then they keep flipped.
-4 - If the two cards do not match then they will flip over.
5 - The game is won when all the appended cards are matched.
6 - There is a timer and move and score system.
7 - Score reduces based on how many time the player's moves.
