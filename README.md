Memory Game project made with â™¥ @ Udacity
# How The Game Works
1 - The game consists of 12 or 16 cards based on what difficulty (EASY - CHALLENGING) the player choose<br /> 
2 - The player has to pick over two cards.<br />
3 - If the two cards match then they keep flipped.<br />
4 - If the two cards do not match then they will flip over.<br />
5 - The game is won when all the appended cards are matched.<br />
6 - There is a timer and move and score system.<br />
7 - Score reduces based on how many time the player's moves.<br />
